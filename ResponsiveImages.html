        <p class='nudge-desktop--smaller'>In <a
            href='./Responsive Design.html'>Responsive Design</a>, we learned how
          to use media queries to create separate mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.
          Now, we’re going to add images to the mix. Just as media queries let us
          conditionally present different CSS rules, we want to display different images
          based on the user’s device.</p>
          
          <figure ><div  style='max-width: 560px'><div class='diagram__padding' style='padding-left: 150px;'><img class='diagram__image' alt='Diagram: low-resolution image sent to standard screen desktop devices and all mobile devices versus high-resolution image sent to retina desktop devices' src='./img/responsiveimage/responsive-images-overview.png' width='560' height='473'/></div></div></figure>
          
          <p>The problem is, images have inherent dimensions. We can’t stretch a photo
          that’s 500&times;250 pixels to anything beyond 500 pixels wide because it’ll
          get pixelated. Retina displays and mobile devices complicate things even more.
          To make our images responsive, we now have to take three things into
          consideration:</p>
          
          <ul style="padding-top: 30px;">
            <li>The device’s dimensions</li>
            <li>The image’s dimensions</li>
            <li>The device’s screen resolution</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>This will be more difficult than media queries, which were only concerned
          with device width. But don’t worry, there are standard ways to solve all these
          problems, and we’ll walk you through them one step at a time.</p>

            <div>
                <p>To experiment with responsive images, we need a responsive website to work
                    with. This chapter will be building off of the example web page we put together
                    in the <a href='/html-and-css/responsive-design/'>previous chapter</a>. We’ll
                    be adding two images to the page so it looks  like the following. This might
                    seem simple, but these images will change depending on the user’s device (which
                    is <em>really</em> cool).</p>

                    <p>If you’re continuing from the last chapter, you simply need to <a
                      href='/html-and-css/responsive-images/responsive-images-5e8a2c.zip'>download these image assets</a> and add them to
                    your project’s <code>images/</code> folder.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you’re just joining us, go ahead and download the <a
                      href='/html-and-css/responsive-images/example-7be588.zip'>complete example project</a>, unzip it, and open it up
                    with Atom. If you’re not familiar with the Atom text editor, be sure to take a
                    read through the <a href='/html-and-css/introduction/#atom-text-editor'>introduction</a> of this
                    tutorial series.</p>

                    <p>In either case, your project files should look like this before moving on.
                    Notice how we have multiple copies of our PNG and JPG images (e.g.,
                    <code>illustration-big.png</code> and <code>illustration-small.png</code>).
                    We’ll be letting the browser pick which one of these it should load depending
                    on the device’s size and screen resolution.</p>

        <!--retina screens-->

        <div class="comprehensive-style">

            <div class="comprehensive-style">

                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>This is our first time worrying about retina devices, so let’s talk a
                    little bit about screen resolution. Retina screens have twice as many pixels
                    per inch than standard-resolution screens. That is to say, each retina pixel is
                    the equivalent of 4 standard pixels. This has a big impact on how images are
                    displayed in a web browser.</p>
                    
                    <figure padding-left:><div padding-left: style='max-width: 400px'><div class='diagram__padding' style='padding-left: 150px;'><img class='diagram__image' alt='Diagram: standard-resolution screen with 4 pixels versus high-resolution screen with 16 pixels' src='./img/responsiveimage/standard-vs-retina-resolution.png' width='400' height='227'/></div></div></figure>
                    
                    <p>To render correctly on a retina device, an image needs to be twice as big as
                    its final display dimensions. For example, if you want to add a 500&times;250
                    pixel image to the page, the corresponding image file needs to be
                    1000&times;500 pixels.</p>
                    
                    <figure padding-left:><div padding-left: style='max-width: 600px'><div class='diagram__padding' style='padding-left: 150px;'><img class='diagram__image' alt='Diagram: High-resolution image shrunk to half size and displayed on retina screen' src='./img/responsiveimage/retina-2x-image-dimensions.png' width='600' height='253'/></div></div></figure>
                    
                    <p>This is actually a bit of a simplification&mdash;not all retina screens are
                    created equal. For instance, the iPhone 6 Plus has <em>three times</em> as many
                    pixels per inch as a standard screen. This tutorial focuses on the 2x use case,
                    but the same techniques apply to 3x retina screens as well.</p>
                    
                    <p>What’s more, standard displays and smaller devices don’t need
                    all those extra pixels in high-resolution images, and sending that much
                    unnecessary data usually results in a bad user experience.</p>

        <!--Responsive SVG images-->

        <div class="comprehensive-style">

            <div class="comprehensive-style">

                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">The easiest way to solve all these problems is with <a
                    href='/html-and-css/links-and-images/#svg-images'>SVG images</a>. They “just
                  work.” Since they’re vector-based, SVGs avoid the screen resolution problems
                  that we’ll see in the next section. Let’s take a look by adding an illustration
                  to our <code>responsive.html</code> page. Replace the existing image in the
                  <code>.content</code> div so that it matches the following:</p>
                  
                  <pre ><code><span >&lt;<span >div</span> <span >class</span>=<span >'section content'</span>&gt;</span>
                    <span >&lt;<span >img</span> <span c>class</span>=<span >'illustration'</span> <span c>src</span>=<span >'images/illustration.svg'</span> /&gt;</span>
                  <span >&lt;/<span >div</span>&gt;</span>
                  </code></pre>
                  
                  <p>Browsers automatically scale up SVGs for retina devices, so this
                  500&times;250 pixel SVG image will render crisply on both standard and retina
                  devices.</p>
                  
                  <p>SVGs let us forget about screen resolution issues, but we do need to shrink
                  the illustration to fit neatly into our fluid tablet and mobile layouts.
                  Firefox will do this automatically, but if you open this page with Chrome and
                  make your browser very narrow, you’ll find that the image stays the same
                  size.</p>
                  
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">To get a fluid image in Chrome, we need to tell the illustration to always
                  fill the width of its container. In <code>styles.css</code>, put the following
                  rule with the rest of the base styles, outside of the media queries:</p>
                  
                  <pre padding-left:><code><span >.illustration</span> {
                    <span >width</span>: <span >100%</span>;
                  }
                  </code></pre>
                  
                  <p>When we specify <code>100%</code> width on an image, it’ll assume we
                  want to maintain its aspect ratio and calculate its height automatically. This
                  fixes the mobile layout, but now the desktop version is <em>huge</em>:</p>
                  
                  <figure ><div class='diagram__wrapper' style='max-width: 575px'><div class='diagram__padding' style='padding-left: 150px;'><img class='diagram__image' alt='SVG image shrinking to fit mobile and tablet widths, but very large in desktop layout' src='./img/responsiveimage/responsive-svg-image.png' width='575' height='450'/></div></div></figure>
                  
                  <p>This behavior is perfect for some designs (like the full bleed photo
                  we’ll see in the next section), but not right now. We want to cap the
                    width of the illustration to its inherent width, which is 500 pixels. We can
                    do this with an <a href='/html-and-css/hello-css/#inline-styles'>inline
                      style</a>:</p>
                  
                  <pre ><code><span >&lt;<span c>div</span> span>class</span>=<span >'section content'</span>&gt;</span>
                    <span >&lt;<span c>img</span> <span c>class</span>=<span >'illustration'</span> <span c>src</span>=<span >'images/illustration.svg'</span> <span c>style</span>=<span >'max-width: 500px'</span>/&gt;</span>
                  <span >&lt;/<span c>div</span>&gt;</span>
                  </code></pre>
                  
                  <p>This is one of the rare times an inline style is acceptable, due to the fact
                  that it’s describing an innate property of the image. An image’s
                  physical dimensions are more content than presentation, so it makes sense for
                  this to appear in the HTML rather than the stylesheet.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Of course, not all images on the web are SVGs. Sometimes you need to include
                a photo. PNG, GIF, and JPG images are “raster images”, meaning that
                they are defined pixel-by-pixel instead of with vectors. As a result, they are
                much more sensitive to screen resolution than SVGs.</p>
                
                <p>If you’re not worried about optimization, responsive raster images
                really aren’t that much harder than using SVG images. Try swapping out
                our existing <code>illustration.svg</code> with a PNG file:</p>
                
                <pre ><code><span >&lt;<span >div</span> <span >class</span>=<span >'section content'</span>&gt;</span>
                  <span >&lt;<span >div</span> <span >class</span>=<span >'illustration'</span>&gt;</span>
                    <span >&lt;<span >img</span> <span >src</span>=<span >'images/illustration-big.png'</span> <span >style</span>=<span >'max-width: 500px'</span>/&gt;</span>
                  <span >&lt;/<span >div</span>&gt;</span>
                <span >&lt;/<span >div</span>&gt;</span>
                </code></pre>
                
                <p>We changed around the HTML structure a bit, nesting our
                <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> tag in another container. Without it, the image would
                get distorted because flexbox would try to set its height to be the same as the
                <code>.content</code> container. This requires a little tweak to our
                <code>.illustration</code> CSS rule, too:</p>
                
                <pre ><code><span >.illustration</span> <span >img</span> {
                  <span >width</span>: <span >100%</span>;
                  <span >display</span>: block;
                }
                </code></pre>
                
                <p>Also notice the <code>-big</code> suffix in the image’s filename. This
                is the high-resolution version of the PNG, which has dimensions of
                1000&times;500. Retina devices need this “2x” size to display the
                image crisply. If we were to use the low-resolution version of this image
                (500&times;250 pixels), it would look fine on standard screens, but fuzzy on
                retina devices.</p>
                
                <figure ><div class='diagram__wrapper' style='max-width: 536px'><div class='diagram__padding' style='padding-bottom: 30px;'><img class='diagram__image' alt='Diagram: serving a high-resolution image to both standard screens and retina screens (which is wasteful)' src='./img/responsiveimage/retina-responsive-images.png' width='536' height='501'/></div></div></figure>
                
                <p>Consider this the lazy way to create responsive PNG, GIF, or JPG images, as
                it assumes everybody needs a high-resolution image, even if they don’t.
                That is to say, a 1000&times;500 pixel image is overkill for non-retina
                devices. We’ll get a little smarter about this in the next section.</p>

            <p>Different devices have different image requirements. Fortunately, HTML
                provides a way to choose the best image for the user’s device. Over the
                next few sections, we’ll take a look at three scenarios for optimizing
                responsive images:</p>
                
                <ul style="padding-top: 30px;">
                  <li>A standard-resolution screen that doesn’t need a retina-quality
                    image.</li>
                  <li>A retina mobile device that can use a standard-quality image because
                    it’s been scaled down so much.</li>
                  <li>A desktop layout that uses a wide image, and an associated mobile
                    layout that uses a taller image.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The first method is the easiest, and it’s great for images smaller than 600
                pixels wide because they aren’t big enough to benefit from the second
                scenario. The second method is a very important optimization for larger images,
                especially full-bleed photos. The third is for when you’re feelin’ fancy.</p>
        </div>

                <div class="rule-line-after"> </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>High-resolution images are big. Our <code>illustration-big.png</code> file
                takes up more than twice as much disk space as its low-resolution counterpart.
                It doesn’t make sense to serve all that extra data when the user
                doesn’t actually need it.</p>
                
                <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Adding a <code>srcset</code> attribute to our <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code>
                element lets us present our high-resolution image <em>only</em> to retina
                devices, falling back to the low-resolution version for standard screens.
                Update our <code>.illustration</code> element to match the following:</p>
                
                <pre ><code><span >&lt;<span >div</span> <span >class</span>=<span>'illustration'</span>&gt;</span>
                  <span >&lt;<span >img</span> <span >src</span>=<span>'illustration-small.png'</span>
                       <span >srcset</span>=<span>'images/illustration-small.png 1x,
                               images/illustration-big.png 2x'</span>
                       <span >style</span>=<span>'max-width: 500px'</span>/&gt;</span>
                <span >&lt;/<span >div</span>&gt;</span>
                </code></pre>
                
                <p>The <code>srcset</code> attribute points to a list of alternative image
                files, along with properties defining when the browser should use each of them.
                The <code>1x</code> tells the browser to display
                <code>illustration-small.png</code> on standard-resolution screens. The
                <code>2x</code> means that <code>illustration-big.png</code> is for retina
                screens. Older browsers that don’t understand <code>srcset</code> fall back to
                the <code>src</code> attribute.</p>
                
                <figure ><div class='diagram__wrapper' style='max-width: 600px'><div class='diagram__padding' style='padding-bottom: 30px;'><img class='diagram__image' alt='Diagram: serving a low-resolution image to a standard screen and a high-resolution image to retina screens' src='./img/responsiveimage/retina-responsive-images.png' width='600' height='501'/></div></div></figure>
                
                <p>Typically, the low-res and high-res versions of an image would be the exact
                same (except for their dimensions), but we made
                <code>illustration-small.png</code> yellow so you can easily differentiate it
                from the retina version, which is blue.</p>
                
                <p>It’s a little hard to see this in action without a real website, so we
                included the previous snippet on this page. The image below should be blue if
                you’re viewing it on a retina device. Otherwise, it will be yellow for
                standard-resolution screens.</p>
                
                
                <figure style='margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;'>
                  <img src='./img/responsiveimage/illustration-small.png'
                       srcset='./img/responsiveimage/illustration-small.png 1x,
                       ./img/responsiveimage/illustration-small.png 2x'
                       style='max-width: 500px'/>
                </figure>
                
                <p>If you’re building these examples on a computer with a retina screen,
                you can also try temporarily changing that <code>2x</code> to <code>1x</code>
                to see what a non-retina image looks like. It’s a little fuzzy (and
                yellow).</p>

            <p>The previous section is perfectly acceptable in terms of optimizing data
                usage. We could stop there and be just fine, but we’re going to get a
                little bit fancier with “art direction”. Think of art direction as
                responsive image optimization for designers.</p>
                
                <p>It lets you optimize <em>layouts</em> by sending completely different images
                to the user depending on their device. Compare this to the previous section,
                which optimized the <em>same</em> image for different devices. For instance,
                our header photo is pretty wide. Wouldn’t it be great if we could crop a
                taller version and present that to mobile devices instead of the wide desktop
                version?</p>
                
                <figure style="padding-left: 150px;"><div class='diagram__wrapper' style='max-width: 600px'><div class='diagram__padding'><img class='diagram__image' alt='Diagram: serving a tall-cropped image to mobile devices and a wide-cropped image to standard- and high-resolution desktop devices' src='./img/responsiveimage/art-direction-with-picture.png' width='600' height='504'/></div></div></figure>
                
                <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">For this, we need the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements. The former is just a wrapper, and the
                latter conditionally loads images based on media queries. Try changing our
                <code>.header</code> element to the following:</p>
                
                <pre ><code><span >&lt;<span >div</span> <span >class</span>=<span >'section header'</span>&gt;</span>
                  <span >&lt;<span >div</span> <span >class</span>=<span >'photo'</span>&gt;</span>
                    <span >&lt;<span >picture</span>&gt;</span>
                      <span >&lt;<span >source</span> <span >media</span>=<span >'(min-width: 401px)'</span>
                              <span >srcset</span>=<span >'images/photo-big.jpg'</span>/&gt;</span>
                      <span >&lt;<span >source</span> <span >media</span>=<span >'(max-width: 400px)'</span>
                              <span >srcset</span>=<span >'images/photo-tall.jpg'</span>/&gt;</span>
                      <span >&lt;<span >img</span> <span >src</span>=<span >'images/photo-small.jpg'</span>/&gt;</span>
                    <span >&lt;/<span >picture</span>&gt;</span>
                  <span >&lt;/<span >div</span>&gt;</span>
                <span >&lt;/<span >div</span>&gt;</span>
                </code></pre>
                
                <p>Conceptually, this is pretty similar to using media queries in CSS. In each
                <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element, the <code>media</code> attribute defines
                <em>when</em> the image should be loaded, and <code>srcset</code> defines
                <em>which</em> image file should be loaded. The <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code>
                element is only used as a fallback for older browsers. You should be able to
                see the tall version of the photo when you shrink your browser window:</p>
                
                <figure ><div class='diagram__wrapper' style='max-width: 424px'><div class='diagram__padding' style='padding-left: 150px;'><img class='diagram__image' alt='Mobile web page with tall-cropped image and desktop web page with wide-cropped image' src='./img/responsiveimage/art-directed-mobile-image.png' width='424' height='499'/></div></div></figure>
                
                <p>This level of control will make your designer very happy, but the trade off
                is that it doesn’t let the browser automatically pick the optimal image.
                This means we lost our retina optimization from the previous section: as long
                as the screen width is 401 pixels or greater, the browser will <em>always</em>
                use the high-resolution, wide-cropped image.</p>
                
                <p>While it is possible to combine the best of both worlds, it gets complicated
                real quick. Our recommendation is to stick to the <code>1x</code> and
                <code>2x</code> version of <code>srcset</code> for images less than 600 pixels
                wide, use the <code>srcset</code> plus <code>sizes</code> method from the
                previous section for bigger photos, and reserve <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>
                for when you’re trying to do something real fancy with your designer.</p>

            <p>Responsive images may seem rather complicated, but there’s really only two
                problems we’re trying to solve:</p>
                
                <ul style="padding-top: 30px;">
                  <li>Make images fit into mobile layouts while respecting their intrinsic size</li>
                  <li>Avoid making the user download unnecessarily large image files</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>We accomplished the former by making images always stretch to fill 100%
                of their container while limiting their size with an inline
                <code>max-width</code> style. For the latter, we used <code>srcset</code> to
                optimize for screen resolution, <code>srcset</code> plus <code>sizes</code> to
                optimize for device width, and finally the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element
                for manual control over which image file is displayed.</p>
                
                <p><a href='./Responsive Design.html'>Responsive design</a> is an
                evolving topic. Browsers only recently implemented the image optimization
                techniques covered in this chapter, despite the fact that responsive design has
                been the standard for half a decade. While the technology used to create a
                responsive website may change, the fundamental problem of presenting the same
                content to different devices will never disappear. So, even if you eventually
                need to learn some new tools, the foundational concepts we just introduced
                should stay with you forever.</p>
                
                <p>These last five chapters focused entirely on layout. We explored floats,
                flexbox, advanced positioning, and how to apply all those concepts to various
                screen widths. This is pretty much everything you’ll ever need to lay out web
                pages with HTML and CSS. The next chapter scuffles back into the world of HTML,
                introducing a bunch of new elements that will make search engines much happier
                with our websites.</p>
