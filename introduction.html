                Learning HTML and CSS is hard, but it doesn’t have to be. This 14-chapter
                tutorial is one of the friendliest HTML and CSS guides on the Internet. We’ll
                walk you through everything from selecting a good text editor (which is surprisingly important)
                to building full-fledged, professional-quality web pages from scratch.

                We designed <a href="./htmlcss.html"> HTML & CSS Is Hard </a> to be the only introduction to
                HTML and CSS that you’ll ever need. If you put in the effort to
                read every section and write every code snippet, this tutorial has the
                potential to replace hundreds or even thousand of dollars worth of online courses and live training.

                Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for complete beginners to become professional web developers,
                so if you’ve never written a line of HTML or CSS, but you’re contemplating a
                career shift, grab a cup of coffee, take a seat, and let’s get to work.

                            HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript
                            are the languages that run the web. They’re very closely related, but they’re
                            also designed for very specific tasks. Understanding how they interact will go
                            a long way towards becoming a web developer. We’ll be expanding on this throughout
                            the tutorial, but the gist of it is:
                        </p>
                    </div> -->
    
                     <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
                        <li>HTML is for adding meaning to raw content by marking it up.</li>
                        <li>CSS is for formatting that marked up content.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript is for making that content and formatting interactive.</li>
                    </div> 
    
                     <div class="html-content-beautiful" style="padding-left: 30px;">
                        <p>
                            Think of HTML as the abstract text and images behind a web page, CSS as
                            the page that actually gets displayed, and JavaScript as the behaviors
                            that can manipulate both HTML and CSS.
                        </p>
                    </div> 
    
                     <div>
                        <img src="./img/introduction/web-tech-employed.png" alt="web tech employed"
                            style="padding-left: 150px;" />
                    </div> 
    
                     <div>
                        <p>For example, you might mark some particular run of text as a
                            paragraph with this HTML:</p>
                        <pre><code><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">'some-paragraph'</span>&gt;</span>This is a paragraph.<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>Then, you can set the size and color of that paragraph with some CSS:</p>
    
                        <pre>
                            <code><span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span> {
                            <span class="hljs-attribute">font-size</span>: <span class="hljs-number">20px</span>;
                            <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: blue;
                            }
                        </code></pre>
    
                        <p>And, if you want to get fancy, you can re-write that paragraph when the user
                            clicks it with some JavaScript (we’ll save the fancy stuff for a future
                            tutorial):</p>
    
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> p = <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">'some-paragraph'</span>);
    p.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">event</span>) </span>{
      p.innerHTML = <span class="hljs-string">'You clicked it!'</span>;
    });
                            </code>
                        </pre>
    
                        <p>As you can see, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are totally different languages,
                            but they all refer to one another in some way. Most websites rely on all three,
                            but the appearance of <em>every</em> website is determined by HTML and CSS.
                            That makes this tutorial a great starting point for your web development
                            journey.</p>

                        Unfortunately, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is only a <i>prerequisite</i>
                        for becoming a professional web developer. There are a bunch of other 
                        practical skills that you need to run a website:
                    </p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="html-content-beautiful">

                        <li>Organizing HTML into reusable templates.</li>
                        <li>Standing up a web server.</li>
                        <li>Moving files from your local computer to your web server.</li>
                        <li>Reverting to a previous version when you screw something up.</li>
                        <li>Pointing a domain name at your server.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                    <p>
                        Dealing with these complexities involves setting up various “environments” to 
                        organize your files and handle the building/deploying of your website. All of 
                        this is orthogonal to the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that make up a website. 
                        This tutorial focuses entirely on the languages of HTML and CSS—not setting up those underlying environments.

                        But, don’t be overwhelmed. Gaining fluency in HTML and CSS is a significant first step 
                        towards becoming a real web developer. We just don’t want you to walk away from this 
                        tutorial thinking that you’ll be able to launch a full website on your own. You will, 
                        however, have the skills to recreate the vast majority of web pages on the Internet.

                    <p>
                        So, what is it to “learn” HTML and CSS? We like to look at it through 
                        a historical lens into the printing industry. Back in the days of the 
                        original printing press, printers created documents by arranging metal 
                        characters, dipping them in ink, and pressing them onto a piece of paper.
                    </p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                    <p>
                        In a lot of ways, that’s exactly what web developers do, except instead 
                        of arranging moveable type, they write HTML and CSS. We’re concerned with 
                        the same task as they were: conveying content in meaningful ways. We even deal 
                        with the same presentational issues they did, like selecting the font to use, setting 
                        the size of headings, and determining the space between lines of text.
                    </p>
                </div>            
            
                <div class="html-content-beautiful">

                <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                    <p>
                        Printers used to print a bunch of pages and bind them into a book. Nowadays, 
                        we create a bunch of HTML files and link them together into a website. Learning 
                        HTML and CSS is a matter of understanding the available HTML markup and CSS rules 
                        to make a browser render those files exactly how they’re supposed to.

                    of every single one of them is to abstract away some of the redundant aspects 
                    of creating web pages from scratch. These kinds of frameworks are an important 
                    part of real-world web development, and they’re definitely worth exploring—but

                    This tutorial is about HTML and CSS fundamentals. You’ll walk away with the 
                    ability build pretty much anything you’ll ever need as a web developer with 
                    raw HTML and CSS. This is stuff that stays with you forever, in spite of shiny 
                    new additions to the HTML and CSS standards or trendy new frameworks that help you do things faster.

                    of what you’ve already read, the entirety of this tutorial revolves around 
                    concrete examples, explaining the conceptual aspects of HTML and CSS along the way.

                    To get the most of out this tutorial, you should be actively creating web pages 
                    and following along with every single step of each chapter. If you’re serious 
                    about becoming a web developer, you should be typing each code snippet character-by-character 
                    instead of copy-and-pasting them into your text editor.

                    Why? Because this is what you’ll actually be doing as a real web developer. Typing out code 
                    examples ingrains the muscle memory that will serve you well once you’re out in the wild and 
                    marking up content for real websites.

                    For this tutorial, a decent text editor and web browser is all you need. 
                    Your basic workflow is to write code in your text editor, then open it up 
                    in a web browser to see how it looks. As you start creating your own websites, 
                    you’ll eventually add more tools to your toolbox, but it’s important to start 
                    out minimal and thoroughly learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

                <p>
                    That said, take the time to get really good at using your text editor. 
                    Decent ones come with features that let you write code faster than you normally 
                    could, like auto-completing tags, jumping around your text, and navigating your 
                    file system. Fully leveraging your text editor is the craftsmanship part of learning HTML and CSS.

                    The only real prerequisite for a good web browser is that it’s up to date and in 
                    mainstream usage. <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> are favorites 
                    amongst web developers. Safari is alright if you’re running OS X, too. We strongly 
                    suggest not creating websites with Internet Explorer. Professional web development 
                    often requires an efficient way to test code on all of these browsers, but that’s a 
                    little more complicated than what we need right now.

                    We recommend the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom </a> text editor. It’s user friendly even for beginners, provides all 
                    the useful features we mentioned above, and is available for all major operating systems. 
                    It’s also infinitely configurable, which will become important as you identify repetitive tasks that you can automate.

                <p>
                    If you don’t already have Atom, go ahead and <a href="https://atom.io/">download it now </a>, since you’ll be 
                    needing it for the next chapter. Once you’ve downloaded it, open it up so we can 
                    take a brief tour of its major features. You should see two panes with different welcome screens:
                </p>

                <p>
                    We don’t need either of these welcome screens, so close both of them by clicking the x icon 
                    in their corresponding tabs. You can also use the Cmd+W (Mac) or Ctrl+W (Windows/Linux) shortcut 
                    to close them (shortcuts are great, use them whenever you can). You should be left with a single untitled tab.

        <!--Creating a Project-->

        <div class="comprehensive-style" class=".list-item-2">

            <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                <p>
                    Each website you work on in Atom is a “project,” which is essentially just 
                    a folder on your file system that contains a bunch of HTML and CSS files. Let’s 
                    explore Atom by creating a fake project and adding a few text files to it. Click 
                    File > Open in the menu bar to open a file dialog window, then select New Folder 
                    to create a new folder. Call it hello-atom, and click Open.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="html-content-beautiful">

            </div>

            <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                <p>
                    You should now see a sidebar on the left of the interface that says hello-atom at the top 
                    next to a little folder icon. This is our file browser. Of course, it won’t show anything 
                    until we add some files, so let’s do that next.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!--Creating Files-->

        
        <div class="comprehensive-style" class=".list-item-2">
            
            <div class="line-rule">

            </div>
        
            <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                <p>
                    Add some arbitrary text to that untitled tab, then hit Cmd+S (Mac) or 
                    Ctrl+S (Windows, Linux) to save the file. Call it page-one.html. After 
                    saving it, you should see it appear in Atom’s file browser.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                <p>
                    Let’s make one more file by hitting Cmd+N (Mac) or Ctrl+N (Windows, Linux). 
                    This will create another untitled tab. As with our last file, add whatever 
                    text you want, then save it as page-two.html.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!--Navigating File System-->

        <div class="comprehensive-style" class=".list-item-2">
            
            <div class="line-rule">
                <div class="rule-line-before"> </div>
                <div class="comprehensive-curriculum">

                <p>
                    Again, one of the most important aspects of a proper text editor is to let you 
                    efficiently navigate all the files in your project. In Atom, you can select the 
                    tab of the file you want to work on or find it in the file browser on the left side 
                    of the interface. You can also use Ctrl+Tab to switch between open tabs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That’s all fine and dandy for browsing files, but there are a lot of times when 
                    you’re searching for a specific file. For instance, imagine discovering a broken 
                    link on your website while you’re doing some quality assurance. You want to be able 
                    to jump into that file with Atom to fix the link as quickly as possible.
                </p>
            </div>

            </div>

            <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                <p>
                    For that, you need Atom’s fuzzy finder, which is accessible via Cmd+T (Mac) or 
                    Ctrl+T (Windows, Linux). When you press this, Atom will open up a search bar and 
                    let you type any part of the filename you’re looking for. Try closing both tabs, 
                    hitting Cmd+T or Ctrl+T, and entering “one”. The page-one.html file should pop up, 
                    and you can hit Enter to edit it. This functionality is indispensable once your project 
                    grows to a few dozen files spread across several folders.

        <!--Multiple File Systems-->

        <div class="comprehensive-style" class=".list-item-2">

                <p>
                    Atom not only lets you have multiple tabs, but multiple panes as well. To see 
                    what we’re talking about, try right-clicking one of the files in the file browser 
                    and selecting Split Right. This will open that file in a new pane, allowing you to 
                    see multiple files at the same time.

                <p>
                    Multiple panes are really useful for examining a CSS file and its related HTML file at the same time.

            </div>

        </div>

        <!--Outside Of Atom-->

            <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                <p>
                    Finally, we’ll occasionally need to work with files outside of the 
                    Atom interface (e.g., when we want to copy image files into our website). 
                    We can use the operating system’s built-in file browser for this. Right-click 
                    a file in Atom’s file browser, then select Show in Finder/Explorer/Some Other 
                    File Browser to open it up in your system’s default file browser.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                <p>
                    From here, you can add new files, create folders, or open up HTML files in a 
                    web browser. That last one is going to become a common task for the rest of this 
                    tutorial, so let’s give it a shot with our page-one.html file. Right-click it in 
                    your system’s default file browser and select Open With > Chrome/Firefox/Safari. 
                    You should see whatever text you added to the file rendered as a web page in your default web browser.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="html-content-beautiful">
                <p>
                    Now, you can edit the contents of page-one.html in Atom, save it, and reload 
                    it in your web browser by pressing Cmd+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Windows, Linux). This is 
                    the basic editing workflow for all web developers, and you’ll become very, very 
                    accustomed to it by the time you’re done working through the next 13 chapters.

                    understanding of how HTML and CSS fit into the broader industry of web development 
                    and the general philosophy behind <a href="htmlcss.html">HTML and CSS Is Hard.</a>

                    The Atom stuff we just covered is going to become part of our daily routine, so make sure 
                    you’re comfortable with everything before moving on. We encourage you to play with the example 
                    project a bit, adding more files and practicing navigating from one to the other. Mastering 
                    the craft of writing HTML and CSS is what distinguishes amazingly productive developers from average ones.

                    Now that we’ve got a proper text editor, we’re ready to start coding up some real 
                    web pages. We’ll start by exploring the most common HTML elements over the next two chapters, 
                    then we’ll add some CSS to the mix.
